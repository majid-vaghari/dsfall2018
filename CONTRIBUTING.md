# Contributing to this Repository

The policies regarding students' contributions to this repository is listed below.

## Submitting Solutions

This repository is **NOT** considered as a means to submit your assignments.
The purpose of this repository is to provide correct solutions to the problems which are informative and educational.

So, submitting solutions to this repository will not affect your score. Nevertheless, it _may_ result in getting bonus points.

If you want to submit your solution for a specific problem it _must_ be in markdown format. There is an [online editor](http://dariubs.github.io/rtlmd/) which supports RTL languages like Persian.

To submit your solutions you need to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

_Please be advised. You are required to wait at least 72 hours after the deadline for each assignment before you submit your solutions; otherwise, **it will be considered an act of academic dishonesty and a direct violation of course policies.**_

### Conventions

Follow the naming conventions. An empty file will be available for each assignment or quiz before its deadline.

Solutions must be in Persian.

Each pull request should contain **only one** solution to **only one** problem.

Please don't send pull requests for exercises that are already solved.

Out of many submitted PRs, only _one_ will be accepted.

## Reporting Issues

If you see a problem with a solution, [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).
